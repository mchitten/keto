This event is so rare that it is, with almost absolute certainty, unlikely for you to encounter ever.\n- `fatal`: the program is unable to continue execution and ended with a fatal state. Can happen when the configuration is invalid, for example.\n- `error`: used for errors that should definitely be noted.\n- `warn`: non-critical entries that deserve eyes.\n- `info`: general operational entries about what's going on inside the application.\n- `debug`: usually only enabled when debugging. Very verbose logging. If `json` is the log format, the JSON will be prettified for better readability.\n- `trace`: designates finer-grained informational events than debug. Includes call traces of errors and log calls.\n",
